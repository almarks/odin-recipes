                <p>Mozzarella sticks are very easy to make at home. They're deep-fried until golden and crispy on the
                    outside, with melted gooey cheese on the inside. They're so good and take just minutes to fry! Try
                    dipping them in a marinara sauce!</p>

                    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                    <li>¼ cup water</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                    <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
                    <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>

                <ol class="">
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a
                        medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
                    <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess
                        egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a
                        plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
                    <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry
                        until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry
                        remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
